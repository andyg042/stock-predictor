# stock-predictor
This point of this project is for me to explore and learn about stocks using a model to help choose a stock to pick. I want to learn more about data science and I'm currently taking a course on Data Mining this semester and hopefully I can use what I learn to help with this. 

Please note that nobody will beat the stock market. If I can I will already be rich by now and not be going to school for CS, haha.
I hope to scrape data of the stock market, then use that to predict what stocks to pick. From there maybe I can run an analysis of comparing what AI picks and some people's pick such as Warren Buffet, and people in Law. I'm looking at you Nancy Pelosi.

I have recruited my friend Ryan Koes, to help me on this project.
